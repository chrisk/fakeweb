fakeweb (1.2.0)

* add lib/fakeweb.rb so you can require "fakeweb" as well [Chris Kampmeier]

* fix compatibility with Ruby 1.9.1 [Chris Kampmeier]

* fix that newlines in file-based responses could be doubled in the response
  object's body [Mark Menard, Chris Kampmeier]

* fix unnecessary munging of the transfer-encoding header, which improves
  compatibility with mechanize [Mark Menard]

* fix a test and the RCov dependency to be compatible with JRuby [Mark Menard]

* remove an unnecessary redefinition of OpenURI::HTTPError [Josh Nichols]

* rearrange implementation code into separate files, one per class [Josh Nichols]

* fix a bug where FakeWeb.response_for would raise if the request wasn't
  registered [Chris Kampmeier]

* add HTTP method support, so FakeWeb takes both the URI and method into
  account for registration, requests, and responses. Backwards-compatible with
  the old method signatures, which didn't have a method param. [Chris Kampmeier]

* start work on Ruby 1.9 compatibility [Chris Kampmeier]

* add FakeWeb.allow_net_connect= to enable/disable the pass-through to
  Net::HTTP for unregistered URIs [Mislav Marohnić, Chris Kampmeier]

* remove setup.rb, since most people use RubyGems [Mislav Marohnić]

* fix that 'http://example.com/?' (empty query) matches a registered
  'http://example.com/', and vice-versa [Mislav Marohnić]

* improve the test suite to not rely on an internet connection [Chris Kampmeier]

* use `rake test` instead of `rake tests` [Josh Nichols]

* fix an incompatibility with Ruby 1.8.6 p36 where you'd get "Errno::EINTR:
  Interrupted system call" exceptions in Socket#sysread for any non-faked
  request [Chris Kampmeier]

* response rotation: you can now optionally call FakeWeb.register_uri with an
  array of options hashes; these are used, in order, to respond to
  repeated requests (to repeat a response more than once before rotating, use
  the :times option). Once you run out of responses, further requests always
  receive the last response. [Michael Shapiro]

* add support for Net::HTTP's undocumented full-URI request style (fixes
  URI::InvalidURIErrors that you might see in older libraries) [Chris Kampmeier]

* sort query params before storing internally, so that
  http://example.com/?a=1&b=2 and http://example.com/?b=2&a=1 are considered the
  same URL (although this is technically incorrect, it's much more
  convenient--most web apps work that way, and Net::HTTP's use of a hash to pass
  query params means that the order in which FakeWeb stores them can be
  unpredictable) [Chris Kampmeier]

* add support for ports in URLs, so that http://example.com/ and
  http://example.com:3000/ are not the same [Chris Kampmeier]

* fix for non-faked SSL requests failing with "Unable to create local socket"
  [Chris Kampmeier]

* update Rakefile to fix warning about deprecated code [Chris Kampmeier]


fakeweb (1.1.2)

* add required dependencies to GemSpec to ensure that tests pass in firebrigade
  (http://firebrigade.seattlerb.org/) [Blaine Cook]


fakeweb (1.1.1)

* fix for non-existence of :string method on File as presented by open-uri
  [Blaine Cook]

* fix for curl example test - google redirects to ccTLDs for those outside US
  [Blaine Cook]


fakeweb (1.1.0)

* update code to correspond to ruby 1.8.4 (breaks compatibility with ruby 1.8.2)
  [Blaine Cook]


fakeweb (1.0.0)

  * initial import [Blaine Cook]
